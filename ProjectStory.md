# Our Project Story

## Inspiration

Our inspiration was building a software that is budget friendly, enabling students to display their creative juices without the need of spending money on drawing tablets.

## What it does

Allow students to view and convert real-life design prototypes to virtual prototype.

## How we built it


## Challenges we ran into


## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We stepped into the field of neural networks with YOLO and DarkNet which had been a great beggining into the field of Deep Learning.

## What we learned

Using Viola Jones algorithm which is very useful in all kinds of object detection.

## What's next for CamScribbler

We really want to optimize project to make it more accessible for an average user
and improve the machine learning model to improve the overall precision of the 
program.
